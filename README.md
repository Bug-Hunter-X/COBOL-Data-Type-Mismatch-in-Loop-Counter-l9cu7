This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a COBOL program involving a data type mismatch in a loop counter.  The loop unexpectedly terminates early due to an implicit data type conversion.  The solution highlights how to explicitly define data types to prevent this issue and improve code readability and maintainability.
